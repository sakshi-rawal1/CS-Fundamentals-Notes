Switch >> used to form  a LAN with a small area like an office

(ISP) Router >> used to connect your network to some other network

Protocols (IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, SMTP, FTP)>> set of rules used by devices in order to communicate>> every protocol has header that defines how the msg should be and 
details of the msg, positions>> sender side attaches the header >> receiver side removes the header processes it and forwards the message to upper layer, finds out the information from the header, does error detection
if error then it might discard the packet 

Why we need layering of protocols >>layers are used to organize protocols>> because we just implement the current layer protocol assuming all the underlying layers protocols are inplace and
implemented correctly >> HTTP does not care about we are using wired network or wifi it just assumes that transport layer has implemented the same 

Two popular models to layer computer networks >> OSI and TCP/IP

OSI >> 7 layer model >> it was never accepted >> its more of conceptual 
Application>> in tcp/ip it directly uses transport layer services >> HTTP(browser) >> SMTP(Mail)>>FTP(file trasnfer) >> SSH(secure server login )
Presentation >> does data processing things>> not there in tcp/ip >> does encryption/decryption and encoding of data on sender side n decoding on receiver side
Session >> not there in tcp/ip>> no particular protocol is responsible here.. RPC implements session layer independently >> combile multiple streams ie Ensures syncronization of msg, does session management n authentication 
Transport >> end to end delivery is done by transport layer >> which exact process should be receiving the msg 
Network >> if we need to connect to a computer which is not directly connected ie server in other country >> Router is Network layer device >> Network layer routes our msg from local network to distant network>> multiple routers are involved in between 
Data Link >>handles one to one communication using ethernet in LAN or via switch ie through shared media or wireless media>> handles flow control,collision handling, error control, error detection, provide access to shared medium 
Physical >>tranfer data in form of bits>>  handles wired or wireless connection between sender and receiver (singals and wires)

in TCP/IP model the network layer use IP and ie connectionless protocol and is unreliable where as network layer of OSI may provide reliable or unreliable services 

TCP/IP Model >> actually implemented 
Application >> Message(units of communication) also called PDUs (Protocol data units)
Transport >> Segments >> uses TCP and UDP 
Network >> Packets >> uses IP 
Link >> Frames >>
